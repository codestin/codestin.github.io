I have been an avid reader of Patrick Rhone's writing for more than a decade. This ranged from his famous blog, [Minimal Mac](https://minimalmac.com/), to his [published works](https://patrickrhone.com/). I make it a point to re-read [Some Thoughts About Writing](https://gum.co/ZBEx) and [This Could Help](http://www.lulu.com/shop/patrick-rhone/this-could-help/paperback/product-21907166.html) every year to reinvigorate my spirit. Even now, I follow his personal [blog](https://www.patrickrhone.net/) and his site dedicated to analog writing tools called [The Cramped](https://thecramped.com). I subsume his wife Bethany Gladhill's [blog](https://prologuist.com) too, as she is an equally fantastic writer. I enjoy getting a glimpse at their family's cozyness, like when they make [lefse](https://prologuist.blogspot.com/2019/12/lefse.html) together for Christmas. Their daughter will become [president](https://www.patrickrhone.net/7016-2/) one day.

Patrick's recent post titled "[To Help and Be Helped](https://www.patrickrhone.net/to-help-and-be-helped/)" struck me because I too struggle with the same. I get tremendous pleasure out of helping others, yet accepting help is something I do with great reluctance. I often have to remind myself of this [Zen Koan](http://home.pon.net/wildrose/BCR-Eng.htm#case89) from the Blue Cliff Record:

>Yunyan asked Daowu, “How does the Bodhisattva of Great Compassion expect to make use of the many hands and eyes?

>Wu said, “It is like a person in the middle of the night whose hands feel back for the pillow.”

The Bodhisattva of Great Compassion, also known as Guan Yin, Kannon*, and many other [names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanyin), is sometimes depicted with a thousand arms and eyes to allow him/her to help as many as possible. Yet, he/she does so in a natural way, without consciously dividing one's thinking into self and not-self. I wonder if passage can apply to accepting help as well--how can one learn to do so without self-consciousness? In the New Post-COVID-19 World, I sense a collective shift in how we help those around us. I'm lucky in that I feel others are more ready to give and receive.

If you can't tell by now, I place Patrick and his family on a pedestal for their ability to keep me writing and contemplating, even when times are hard. I hope this short ode from a stranger on the internet can reflect all the hope and motivation they have given me throughout the years!

*Fun Fact: I learned the other day from [Gil Fronsdal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLgt034wOL0) that [Canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_Inc.) the camera company is in fact, named after the Bodhisattva!
