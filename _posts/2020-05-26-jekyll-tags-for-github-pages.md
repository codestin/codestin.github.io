I was stuck on generating tags for posts using Jekyll hosted by Github Pages. Github Pages is great because it is free and integrated into the github's version control, but they do not allow most Ruby Gems like...jekyll-tags! After a lot of hunting on the internet, I would like to sing some praises for these [instructions](https://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/) by Long Qian, because they were the only ones that worked for me in a straightforward way. 

- I also want to share one tidbit I figured out after some fiddling with Jekyll's Liquid template language. 
- For example, on the [Commonplace](https://christinchong.com/commonplace/) page, I wanted to be able to display the entry's tag next to the entry's name. 
- Here's the code that worked for me:

{% raw %}
```liquid
{% for category in site.categories %}
  <div class="archive-group">
    {% capture category_name %}{{ category | first }}{% endcapture %}
    <div id="#{{ category_name | slugize }}"></div>
    <p></p>
    
    <h3 class="category-head">{{ category_name }}</h3>
    <a name="{{ category_name | slugize }}"></a>
    {% for post in site.categories[category_name] %}
    <article class="archive-item">

          {% for tag in post.tags %}
          {% capture tag_name %}{{ tag }}{% endcapture %}
          <a href="/tag/{{ tag_name }}"><nobr>{{ tag_name }}</nobr></a>
          {% endfor %}
    Â·   
      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{{ post.url }}">{% if post.title and post.title != "" %}{{post.title}}{% else %}{{post.excerpt |strip_html}}{%endif%}</a>   


    </article>
    {% endfor %}

{% endfor %}
```
{% endraw %}

- On a meta-level, I could not figure out how to share my code above without Jekyll trying to render it and breaking in the process. 
- I solved this by going into Long Qian's [raw Markdown post](https://github.com/qian256/qian256.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2017-02-09-github-jekyll-tag.md) on github and seeing how he did it.
- Next to fix is the rouge code highlighting theme...not a huge fan of the big block of dark mode above!
- My goal is to understand all aspects of this Jekyll theme and open source it after some clean up.
