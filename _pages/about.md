# Site Notes
- This website is built upon [Indie Web principles](https://indieweb.org/principles). 
- The base Jekyll theme used is [Reverie](https://github.com/amitmerchant1990/reverie), created by [Amit Merchant](https://www.amitmerchant.com) based on a fork of [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). Thanks Amit!

# Change log
- **2020-06-01**: Added commonplace category descriptions, welcoming banner, fix URL capitalizations (changed to all lower case)
- **2020-05-16**: Updated fonts and layout to improve website esthetics. In particular, used Kevin McGillivray's [typeguide.css](https://github.com/kmcgillivray/typeguide.css), which is in turn inspired by [Butterick's Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com).
